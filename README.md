# KENKEN-Puzzle
Create a software that solves the KENKEN puzzle, By a constrain satisfaction problem (CSP)
 
 #GUI supports:
 
  1-Generating random board of a size that a user will provide
  
  2 Choosing one of the 3 algorithms and running the solver to fill the board with the
answer

 3- Performance Analysis comparing running the 3 algorithms 
 
#steps to play

 1-choose size by writing 3 for size 3x3 or 4 for size 4x4 or 5 for size 5x5 or 6 for size 6x6 or 7 for size 7x7 or 8 for size 8x8 or 9 for size 9x9
 
 2-click on Enter size Button

 3-next window will open and the size generated on it
 
 4-choose the algorithm you want to solve the game by clicking on Button 
 
   4.1-Backtracking 
   
   4.2-Backtracking with forward chicking
   
   4.3-Backtracking with arc consistency

 5-the time will be appear for each algorithm

 6-to close the game click on Close button
 
 #hints 
 
 1-you can generate onle one in each game to generate different you should open the gui again
