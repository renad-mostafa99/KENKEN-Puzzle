## KENKEN-Puzzle

Create a software that solves the KENKEN puzzle, By a constrain satisfaction problem (CSP).

## To Run the project 
### From exe file 
1. download gui folder 
2. in this folder You can find gui.exe that can run easly 

> :warning: ** You cannot run gui.exe without the files and folders in gui folder!

### from vs code
1. download gui.py and algorithm_csp
2. download nessary libraries for pyqt5 

hint : You need to have Python installed on your device
 
## GUI supports
 
  1. Generating random board of a size that a user will provide.
  
  2. Choosing one of the 3 algorithms and running the solver to fill the board with the answer.

  3. Performance Analysis comparing running the 3 algorithms. 
 
## Steps to play

1. Choose size by writing 3 for size 3x3 or 4 for size 4x4 or 5 for size 5x5 or 6 for size 6x6 or 7 for size 7x7 or 8 for size 8x8 or 9 for size 9x9.

2. Click on Enter size Button.

3. Next window will open and the size will be generated on it.
 
4. Choose the algorithm you want to solve the game with by clicking on the Button. 
 
   4.1. Backtracking. 
   
   4.2. Backtracking with forward chicking.
   
   4.3. Backtracking with arc consistency.

 5. Performance analysis (time) will appear for each algorithm.

 6. To close the game click on Close button.
 
 ## Hints 
 
 * You can generate only once in each game to generate again you should open the gui again.
